# An Example Article

This is better than lorem ipsum. Don't you think?

## Example Article Subsection

This could have been something more. But it's not.

I tried though.

## The Final Section for Example Article

One last note. I can still use links based on slugs to an [author]{{jcastillo2nd}} or any other page including [this one]{{example}}.

# Finally

That was it for the example.
